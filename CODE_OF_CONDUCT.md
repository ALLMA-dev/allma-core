# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to fostering a community where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the designated enforcement body at **conduct@allma.dev**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The enforcement body is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. It is also obligated to protect community members from any form of retaliation.

The enforcement body has the authority to issue consequences for any behavior they determine to be in violation of this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When determining the consequences for a violation of this Code of Conduct, the enforcement body will consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

*   **Severity and Impact:** The seriousness of the violation and its impact on the affected person(s) and the community.
*   **Pattern of Behavior:** Whether the violation is an isolated incident or part of a pattern of behavior.
*   **Intent:** Whether the violator intended to cause harm.
*   **Power Dynamics:** Whether the violation was committed by someone in a position of power or influence.
*   **Vulnerability:** Whether the violation was directed at a particularly vulnerable person or group.
*   **Context:** The context in which the violation occurred.

Consequences for violations of this Code of Conduct may include, but are not limited to:

*   A private or public reminder of the community's standards.
*   A private or public warning.
*   A request for a public or private apology.
*   Required attendance at a training or workshop.
*   A temporary or permanent ban from the community.
*   Reporting the behavior to the relevant authorities.

The enforcement body will strive to be fair and impartial in its enforcement of this Code of Conduct. It will also strive to be transparent in its decision-making process, while respecting the privacy of those involved.
