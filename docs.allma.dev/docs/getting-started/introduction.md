# Introduction: What is Allma?

**Allma is a serverless, event-driven platform designed to build, execute, and manage complex, AI-powered automated workflows, known as Flows.**

Think of it as a "digital factory" for your business processes. It provides the assembly line, the machinery, and the quality control systems needed to orchestrate sophisticated workflows that combine data integration, conditional logic, and advanced AI capabilities in a robust, scalable, and observable environment.

## The Problem Allma Solves

In modern enterprises, critical business processes often require stitching together multiple systems:
- Fetching data from a CRM.
- Calling a third-party API for enrichment.
- Applying business rules and logic.
- Invoking an LLM to summarize, classify, or generate content.
- Storing the results in a database.
- Notifying downstream systems.

Building these workflows from scratch is complex. Developers need to solve recurring, difficult problems:
- **State Management:** How do you pass data between steps and keep track of progress?
- **Error Handling:** What happens if an API call fails? How do you retry gracefully?
- **Observability:** When a workflow fails, how do you quickly find the root cause? How can you inspect the data at every single step?
- **Scalability:** How does the system handle 10 executions per hour, and how does it handle 10,000?
- **AI Integration:** How do you securely manage prompts, handle different AI model providers, and validate the output of an LLM?

## The Allma Philosophy: A Serverless AI Orchestration Factory

Allma is built to solve these problems so your team can focus on business logic, not boilerplate infrastructure. Our core philosophy is built on a few key ideas:

- **Declarative & Visual:** Define your workflows as simple, version-controlled JSON or build them visually in a drag-and-drop editor. The "what" is more important than the "how."
- **Serverless First:** Leverage the power of the cloud to build an infinitely scalable, resilient, and cost-effective platform with zero operational overhead. No servers to patch, manage, or scale.
- **Unparalleled Observability:** Provide deep, step-by-step visibility into every execution. Debugging a distributed system should be as easy as debugging local code.
- **Extensible by Design:** Provide pre-built components for common tasks (API calls, LLM invocations) but offer clear, secure patterns for integrating your own custom code and systems.
